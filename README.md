# Description

This is a modified budget tracker application that allows offline access and functionality for tracking expenses and deposits to a user's finances. This application is perfect for travelers who want to keep their budget up to date while travelling without an internet connection. Users receive notifications that transactions have been added upon reestablishing an internet connection. Users are also able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If transactions are entered offline, the total is updated when a connection is restored.

This project includes a Web Manifest as a mobile-first application to let users’ devices know what they’re installing and how the app should look on the home screen.​
